# JurrasicPark
 a log for dinosaurs in the park

This program was created to test out the capabilities of Maven and JUnit tests. I therefore tried to make as many variable tests for my base program.
I settled on Jurassic Park as my theme for three reasons.
1) I wanted this to be fun and I enjoy the movie(s) every so often.
2) It allowed me variable to manipulate yet be straight forward with.

3) This being the first true program we had Maven to work with, I didn't want to go too far outside my comfort zone. Hopefully more adventerous programs are to come.
